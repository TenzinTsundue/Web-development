### What is a Front End Developer?
>front end developers code websites using the building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re the ones who take a design and develop it into a website that works.

## 1. HTML/CSS
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. A markup language is your way of making notes in a digital document that can be distinguished from regular text. It’s the most basic building block you’ll need for developing websites.

## 2. JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY
Where HTML and CSS determine the presentation of a page, JS determines the function. In some instances a very simple website or web page is fine, but for situations where you need interactive features—audio and video, games, scrolling abilities, page animations—JS is the tool you’ll use to implement them (though as CSS evolves, it’s starting to handle a lot of these duties as well).

JS libraries like jQuery, a collection of plugins and extensions that make it faster and easier to use JS on your website. jQuery takes common tasks that require multiple lines of JS code and compresses them into a format that can be executed with a single line.

## 3. CSS AND JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS

CSS and JavaScript frameworks are collections of CSS or JS files that do a bunch of the work for you by providing common functionality (think logging into a website or searching a blog). Instead of starting with an EMPTY text document you start with a code file that has lots of awesome JS already in it.

It’s common to pair **Bootstrap** with another JavaScript framework like **AngularJS**. The content is handled by Angular, and the look & feel is handled by Bootstrap (with some CSS sprinkled in, too).

## 4. CSS PREPROCESSING

CSS limitations is the fact that you can’t define variables, functions, or perform arithmetic operations. This is a problem when a project grows in scale and code base, as you’ll soon find yourself wasting a lot of time writing repetitive code to make changes. Like CSS (and JS) frameworks, CSS preprocessing is another means of making your life as a developer easier and more flexible.

Using a CSS preprocessor like **Sass, LESS**, or **Stylus**, you’re able to write code in the preprocessor’s language

## 5. VERSION CONTROL/GIT

Version control software—like open source stalwart **Git**—is a tool you’ll use to track changes so you can go back to a previous version of your work and find out what went wrong without tearing the whole thing down.

## 6. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

These days we use any number of computers, phones, and tablets to look at web pages. Ever notice how these pages adjust themselves to the device you’re using without you doing anything on your end? This is due to responsive design. Understanding responsive design principles and how to implement them on the coding side is key to front end development.

## 7. TESTING/DEBUGGING

From a website for your mom’s dog walking business to an international site for online banking, bugs are a reality of the development process. In order to keep things moving you’ll need to test your code for bugs along the way, so the ability to test and debug makes the list of essential skills for front end developers.

Testing is a big part of the front end development process, but fortunately, it’s another area where there are frameworks to help you. Programs like **Mocha** and **Jasmine** are designed to speed up and simplify your testing process.

## 8. BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS

All modern web browsers come equipped with developer tools. These tools allow you to test and fine tune your pages in the browser itself, in ways specific to how the browser is interpreting your code.

Browser developer tools generally consist of an **inspector** and a **JavaScript console**. The inspector allows you to see what the runtime HTML on your page looks like, what CSS is associated with each element on the page, and also allows you to edit your HTML and CSS and see the changes live as they happen. The JS console allows you to view any errors that occur as the browser tries to execute your JS code.

## 9. BUILDING AND AUTOMATION TOOLS/WEB PERFORMANCE

better web performance can be another front end time-sink, but that’s where building and automation tools come in. Programs like **Grunt** and **gulp** can be used to automate image optimization, CSS and JS minifying, and other web performance chores.

## 10. COMMAND LINE

There are going to be times when you’ll need to open a terminal on your computer where you can enter typed commands (command line) to get what you need.

It’s the difference between your computer only yielding what’s available on the surface and being able to get what you need by digging in with your bare hands.

Even if the majority of your work is still done through a GUI, you’ll add serious cred to your front end skills if you have a mastery of the command line.
