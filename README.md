As the Web has grown more complex and as more becomes possible on the Internet, developers have gotten more specialized. That means that web development now means a lot of different things depending on what a web developer specializes in. Here are the three main categories:

- **Front end development** (the visible parts of a website or app)
- **Back end development** (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)
- **Full stack development** (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)

## What is a Front End Developer?
>Front end developers build the visible parts of websites that users see and interact within their web browsers.

The front end of a website (or web or mobile application) is the part a user sees and directly interacts with. The front end is built with languages like:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the backbone of the Web. Every website you visit is built with HTML. It takes care of all the structure and content. HTML5 is the current iteration of HTML on the Web, although sites built with older versions still run fine in your browser.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is what controls the way the HTML looks on the page. CSS sets the colors, fonts, background images, and even the way the page is laid out (you can use CSS to arrange the HTML elements on a page however you want, even if it’s different than the order they’re arranged in the HTML file). CSS3 is the current iteration of CSS on the Web, and it adds a ton of features for things like basic interactivity and animations.

**JavaScript** lets you add in interactivity, more complex animations, and even makes it possible to build fully-featured Web applications. There have been advances in JavaScript itself (including the creation of frameworks like **AngularJs, jQuery, and Node.js**).

## What is a Back End Developer?

>Back end developers build the “under the hood” parts of websites that users don’t interact with directly.

Back end programming languages include:

- PHP
- Ruby
- Python

## What is a Full Stack Developer?

>**Full stack developer** is a web developer or engineer who works with both the front and back ends of a website or application—meaning they can tackle projects that involve databases, building user-facing websites, or even work with clients during the planning phase of projects.

Full stack web developers:

- Are familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more back end languages.
- Most full stack developers specialize in a particular back end programming language, like Ruby or PHP or Python, although some, especially if they’ve been working as a developer for a while, work with more than one. In job listings, you’ll generally see openings for “full stack Ruby developer” or the like.
- Some full stack developers especially in 2019 also learn either project management, visual design, web design, or user experience skills—to complete their “stack” if you will

Many full stack web developers spend the majority of their time in either the front or back end code of a site. But the point is that they know enough about the code across the entire stack that they can dive in anywhere if needed.

**Full stack development** includes pretty much any project where you’re working on (or building) both the front and back end of a site or app at the same time. Essentially, it’s any web development project that would normally require both a front end developer and back end developer—but instead, a full stack developer fills the role of both.

### The difference between a full stack develper an full stack engineer?

>A full stack engineer is a senior level role for someone with the skills of a full stack developer (as described above), but with project management experience in things like systems administration (configuring, managing, and maintaining computer networks and systems).

### What skill do I need to become a full stack developer?

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Ideally, one or more third-party library like ReactJS or Angular
- Programming languages and libraries like Ruby, PHP, Python
- Experience with databases
- Version control
- Knowledge of security concerns and best practices
Ideally, some knowledge of web or visual design, plus user experience best practices
