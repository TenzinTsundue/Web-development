This list will provide guidance to find your path through the web development jungle in 2019. Together with a short description of the relevant topics this post contains link to great learning resources so that you can start quickly to expand your skill-set.

## Foundation
---
The best way to begin your web development career with is to get very good at HTML & CSS which is the basis for everything else.

### HTML and CSS

## Programming Languages
---
### JavaScript

JavaScript is the essential building block for adding dynamic features to your website. The JavaScript language is an implementation of the underlying ECMAScript specification. Learning JavaScript from the ground up is an essential milestone in starting your web development career. For many frameworks on the front-end (*Angular, React, Vue.js*) and on the back-end side (*Node.js*) the knowledge of JavaScript is a prerequisite.

### TypeScript

With the rise of Angular TypeScript has gained a lot of traction too. If you’re planning to learn Angular you should definitely take a look at TypeScript first.
TypeScript is an addition to JavaScript and therefore is always used together with JavaScript to enable features like type checking.

### Python

If you’re learning Python for web development you should then take a look at Python web programming frameworks like *Django* or *Flask*.

## Front-end Frameworks
---
Before starting to use a framework you should always try to gain a profound understanding of the underlying technology stack (e.g. JavaScript).

### Angular

Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and JavaScript / TypeScript. The framework combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.

### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

### Vue.js

Vue is extremely easy to learn and especially for smaller-sized projects a perfect choice. The learning curve is extremely steep and you can expect to quickly see great results.

## Back-end Frameworks
---

There are many options you can choose from when selecting a back-end framework for your web project. However, in the following I’ll narrow it down to two options, one for the JS world (Node.js) and one for the Python world (Django).

### Node.js

Node.js enables you to execute JavaScript code at the back-end and is extremely powerful especially if Node.js is used together with the Express middle-ware.
In order to start with Node.js you should first make sure that you have a sound knowledge of the JavaScript programming language. This will ensure that you can understand the core concepts of Node quickly.

### Django

Django is completely written in Python. If you like the elegance of the Python programming language you’ll like the Django. Django is a powerful framework and serves you for a wide range of use cases. However, if you have gained a profound understanding of Python, Django is easy to learn and you’ll discover the pragmatic approach very quickly.

## Misc
---

### Git

Git is by far the most widely used version control system for any kind of source code.
If you are working as a developer today you will sooner or later get into contact with Git and GitHub. As a version control system Git is used by many companies already and most of the frameworks and extensions presented in that article are also hosted on GitHub.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is one of the top trending topics of 2018 for developers. In the coming years, there won’t be a single industry in the world untouched by Machine Learning. With frameworks like Tensorflow.js Machine Learning is now entering the field of web development as well.
